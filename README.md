	-	ft_strncpy
		-	Not working with empty strings?
	-	ft_strlcat
		-	???
	-	ft_strncat
		-	Read to many bytes?


	-	ft_strtrim:
		-	Works with 42FileChecker, but the means seem overly tedious


	-	ft_putnbr*:
		-	fix the same way ft_itoa was fixed? Just strdup int min?


	-	ft_putchar/str*:
		-	Doesn't work with unicode. Can try make it work, but it isn't
			necessary for it to work
